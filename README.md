# Support Sears Lane!
This is a static site that is built with the express purpose of educating the public about the Sears Lane Community located in Burlington, VT. 

The community has been given extremely unfair, biased press and it has led to the eviction of innocent, houseless people who are struggling to scrape by in the capitalist hellscape that is the United States. Vermont may be a mainstay for progressive ideas, but progressives are not immune to the colonialist mindset that puts greed and violence at the forefront.

Please consider [visiting this site](https://searslanecommunity.netlify.app/) and learning more about the community.

If you're curious about what exactly is at stake here, consider [reading this think piece](https://www.rakevt.org/2021/10/29/sears-lane-must-be-defended/) about how evictions like these support a bleaker big-picture view of our world.
