  <p>The residents of the Sears Lane Community in Burlington, VT are in crisis.
    <span>The
      city is attempting to forcibly evict this long-established encampment.</span> Not
  only is this inhumane, it is cruel because it is on the precipice of the
  state's most dangerous season - winter. It goes without saying that this is
  doubly worrisome during a pandemic that has unhoused several and has killed
  more than a half a million in this country alone.</p>

  <p>Everyone has a right to live and flourish on this planet. Those of the Sears Lane Community are no
    different. Our capitalist society makes it extremely difficult for those
    that don't make the cut for its exclusive club to make ends meet. <span>Especially
    in times like these, we have to stand in solidarity against this colonialist
    mindset that has caused unnecessary violence worldwide.</span></p>

  <p>The looming eviction of Sears Lane is just one example of this of many.</p>

  <p><span>What can you do to help?</span> Below are some links to help inform as well as to
    mobilize supporters.</p>
