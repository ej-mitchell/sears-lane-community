  <h2> PRESS RELEASE October 21, 2021 From SEARS LANE COMMUNITY CAMP </h2>
  <p>On Monday October 17, residents of the Sears Lane Camp appealed to the
    Superior Court of Chittenden County for a stay of the closure of their
    community. Yesterday, Wednesday Oct 19, the court scheduled an emergency
    hearing to consider whether to issue a temporary injunction against the
    closure of the camp. <span>Were it to issue said injunction, then the court would
      later consider whether to prohibit the closure of the camp entirely.</span></p>
  <p>That emergency hearing is scheduled for October 28, two days after the
    announced closure of the camp by the Weinberger administration. <span>It is
    presumed that the City will not act until after the hearing, and a ruling on
    the temporary stay is issued.</span> If the court issues the temporary stay, the
    City will be unable to close the camp until after the court issues a final
    decision, if that decision is favorable to the city.</p>
  <p>Members of the camp welcome their day in court. “Yea, let’s do this!” was the
    sentiment. Grey explains <span>“We look forward to this opportunity to be heard within
this construct, and need the court to interrupt the violence that is being
committed against us.”</span></p>
  <p>Police harassment of the camp has escalated. When a resident of the camp
    was investigating rock throwing, Police arrested him. They have also taken
    to circling the camp at night with their lights off. If the police would
    like to protect the community, they could do it openly and with
    conversations with the camp members. Failure to engage camp members in open
    dialog perpetuates the one-sided argument that supposes hostility or malice
    from the camp. <span>This is easily dissolved when both parties engage with each
      other.</span></p>
  <p><span>Members ask that they be allowed to live their lives.</span> Members of the camp are
inspired by the love and solidarity that has been shown to them by the greater
Burlington community, are starting a daily check-in, and have been inspired by
the acceleration of the cleanup.</p>
  <p>City officials were expected today in camp, to discuss the moveout with
    campers, but instead brought in trucks and personnel, without consultation
    or permission of community members, in an overbearing show of authority and
    power, demonstrating their contempt for and the invisibility of the campers.
    They are expected to return tomorrow with dump-trucks to begin “cleaning”.
    This assaultive and disruptive display escalates the subjugation of the
    members of this community. Cleanup should begin only after the community
    members have left or another agreement has been reached with the community.
    The original notice to the camp did not indicate that this work would begin
    before the eviction date. The City is showing that it intends to clear the
    camp before campers have been allowed due process in the Chittenden County
    Court.</p>
  <p><span>The camp has chosen spokespersons. They are Grey Barreda, Alexus Grundy,
    and Noah Lincoln. Press are asked to look for these persons when they visit
    the camp.<span></p>
