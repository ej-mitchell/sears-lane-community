    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
    <h3>Information</h3>
Burlington is evicting our houseless comrades! We need your support!<br>
<span>The Council has to discuss a resolution to halt the evictions on MONDAY
  (10/25). Show up!</span><br>
The City of Burlington gave campers at Sears Lane in the South End 5 DAYS NOTICE to leave or face legal consequences. This comes directly after the city had put out a request seeking a non-profit to help manage the encampment in a way that would allow for some of the structures and people to remain in place. The Request for Proposals (RFP) was only open for TWO WEEKS, so no one was able to respond.<br>
Instead of following through with that program, as imperfect as it was, the City conducted a raid on the camp. Now, because ONE person was arrested, the entire camp has been threatened with legal action if they don't leave by the 26th of Oct. (The pressure we brought to City Council last week gave campers another week!)<br>
We need to show up for our friends-- join us. Speak out on MONDAY at City Council-- Demand that the Mayor and his administration stop the eviction! This sudden reversal of tactics is cruel-- especially since all of Burlington's shelters are consistently completely full, and winter is going to be here soon.<br>
